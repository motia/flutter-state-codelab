# Flutter state managemet codelab

A flutter codelab about state management.
It starts with an introduction to stateless and stateful widgets, using a simple counter app.
Then moves to managing a more complex UI with multiple screens using the Bloc pattern with RxDart.

Credit to for the design of the UI to [the simple state management example in flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/simple)
